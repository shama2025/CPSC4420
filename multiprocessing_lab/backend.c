/**
 * This file will feature a simple backend that will take network requests
 * from an agent and put them into an array
 *  This backend will need to utilize sockets, so building a basic socket
 *  is needed
 * 
 * Once there are no more requests, the array will start iterating through and
 * creating forks to handle the process
 * 
 * The data the agent needs will need to have the child process 
 * that handled the requests
